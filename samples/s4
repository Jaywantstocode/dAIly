Today was a great day at school. I met someone new, her name is Sarah. I was really excited to talk to her because she seemed like a really nice person. I was a little bit nervous at first, but as soon as we started talking, I felt like we had known each other for a long time.

We met in our English class. We were paired up for a group project, and from the moment we started working together, I felt a connection with her. She was funny, kind and we had a lot in common. We talked about our favorite books and movies and I was surprised to find out we had a lot of similar interests.

During lunchtime, we decided to sit together and continue our conversation. It was nice to have someone to talk to and I felt like I finally found someone who I could be myself with. I felt like I could tell her anything and she would understand.

After school, we exchanged phone numbers and made plans to hang out over the weekend. I was really excited to spend more time with her and get to know her better.

I couldn't believe how fast we clicked and how easy it was to talk to her. I'm really looking forward to getting to know her better and seeing where this friendship will take us. I'm so glad I met her, she's the kind of friend I've been looking for.
