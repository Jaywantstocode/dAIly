Today was Halloween, and I went trick or treating with my friends. I was so excited to go out and collect as much candy as possible. I dressed up as a witch, and my friends were a vampire, a ghost and a zombie. We had a great time planning our costumes together.

We started our trick-or-treating adventure in the early evening, as soon as it got dark. The streets were decorated with spooky decorations and the houses were lit up with Halloween lights. The air was filled with the smell of pumpkin and the sound of children laughing.

We went from house to house, ringing doorbells and shouting "Trick or Treat!" We received a lot of candy and some of the houses had really cool decorations. The best part was seeing all the different costumes of the people who answered the door.

As we walked around the neighborhood, I felt a sense of excitement and joy. I felt like a kid again, and I couldn't stop smiling. My friends and I were having a great time together, laughing and joking around.

We ended the night by going to a Halloween party at one of our friend's house. We played games, danced and ate candy until we couldn't eat anymore. We had so much fun together, and I felt grateful for the memories we made.

As I lay in bed tonight, my pillowcase filled with candy, I felt content and happy. Halloween is one of my favorite holidays, and I'm glad I got to spend it with my friends this year. I can't wait to see what next Halloween brings!
