Today was a pretty mundane day. I didn't get a lot done, and I felt pretty unproductive. I woke up feeling a bit groggy and had a hard time getting out of bed. I dragged myself through the morning routine, and I didn't have much energy or motivation.

I had a to-do list for the day, but I just couldn't seem to get started on any of the tasks. I kept finding myself scrolling through social media, watching videos and procrastinating. I felt a bit guilty for wasting time but I couldn't help it.

I decided to take a break and went for a walk, but even that didn't seem to help. I came back feeling just as unmotivated as before. I tried to focus on my work again, but I found my mind wandering and I couldn't seem to concentrate.

I had planned to cook dinner, but I ended up ordering takeout instead. I couldn't be bothered to put in the effort. I spent the rest of the evening watching TV, feeling a bit disappointed in myself for not getting more done.

I went to bed feeling a bit down and unfulfilled, I couldn't shake off the feeling of having wasted a day. I hope tomorrow will be better.
