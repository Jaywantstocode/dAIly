Monday, January 24th

Today was a day I never thought would come. My parents announced to my sister and me that they are getting a divorce. I'm not sure how to feel. I am heartbroken and confused, but also relieved that the tension and fighting that has been going on for so long will finally be over.

It's hard to believe that the two people who I have always looked up to and trusted to be there for each other are now ending their marriage. I have so many questions and I'm not sure if I'll ever get the answers I need.

My sister and I sat in the living room while they told us the news. My mother cried while my father remained stoic. They both apologized and said they still loved us and that this was the best decision for everyone involved. But I couldn't help but feel that their love for each other was more important than their love for us.

I can't help but feel guilty for all the times I wished they would just get divorced and put an end to their constant fighting. I never imagined it would actually happen and now that it has, I'm not sure how to move forward.

I'm scared about what the future holds for our family. Will we be able to maintain a relationship with both parents? Will we have to choose sides? Will our family ever be the same again?

I feel like my world has been turned upside down. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I just want to crawl into bed and forget this day ever happened.
