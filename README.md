## Introduction

dAIly is a diary app that uses Cohere API to create a summary of events that have occured in a given time period from information collected from a user's diary entries.

Journaling has been shown to have multiple positive impacts including reducing anxiety, improving ones immune system, and even aiding in goal-achievement!

In light of this evidence, many want to incorporate journaling into their own lives. While many journaling apps do exist, there is a gap in the market for an app that focuses on journaling through retrospective reflection. In addition, many of the current apps require manual work on the user's end for data collection.

It is our goal to create a diary app that provides users with an effortless way to look back and explore their ideas, thoughts, and feelings through journaling.
